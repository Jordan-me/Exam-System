# Exam-System

In the program you can see a graphical user interface (relatively simple) that allows you to create tests in several ways.
**In order to create a test manually:** 
the user will have to choose from the database of open-ended or American questions 
(if he chooses an American question, he will also have to choose the options that will be in the test).

**In order to create a test automatically:**
you just need to enter the number of questions you want in the test.

**You can also edit the question / answer database by: adding a question (American / Open), editing an existing question and removing a question from the database.**

In this project we have implementation of: MVC pattern,GUI.
